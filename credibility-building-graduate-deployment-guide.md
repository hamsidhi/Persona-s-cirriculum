## üîß **Graduate-Specific Troubleshooting**

### **Common Academic Performance Issues**

#### **1. Low Research Progress Rates**
**Problem:** Graduate students struggling to maintain research momentum
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Identify and optimize low-progress research patterns
WITH research_progress_analysis AS (
    SELECT 
        gp.user_id,
        gp.full_name,
        gp.research_domains,
        AVG(rp.progress_percentage) as avg_research_progress,
        COUNT(rp.project_id) as active_projects,
        AVG(EXTRACT(DAYS FROM (CURRENT_DATE - rp.start_date))) as avg_project_age_days
    FROM graduate_profiles gp
    LEFT JOIN research_projects rp ON gp.user_id = rp.user_id
    WHERE rp.start_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '12 months'
    GROUP BY gp.user_id, gp.full_name, gp.research_domains
    HAVING AVG(rp.progress_percentage) < 40 -- Low progress threshold
)
SELECT 
    user_id,
    full_name,
    'research_acceleration' as recommendation_type,
    CASE 
        WHEN avg_project_age_days > 365 THEN 'Consider project scope reduction and milestone restructuring'
        WHEN active_projects > 3 THEN 'Focus on 1-2 primary projects for deeper impact'
        WHEN avg_research_progress < 20 THEN 'Schedule intensive research mentoring sessions'
        ELSE 'Implement weekly progress checkpoints with advisor'
    END as specific_recommendation
FROM research_progress_analysis;
```

#### **2. Publication Pipeline Stagnation**
**Problem:** Graduate students not advancing from research to publication
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Optimize publication pipeline development
UPDATE research_projects 
SET publications_planned = GREATEST(1, publications_planned),
    expected_outcomes = expected_outcomes || 
        '["Publication opportunity assessment completed", "Writing timeline established"]'::JSONB
WHERE current_phase IN ('analysis', 'writing') 
AND publications_generated = 0
AND start_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '18 months';

-- Create publication acceleration plan
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION accelerate_publication_pipeline(p_user_id UUID)
RETURNS JSONB AS $$
DECLARE
    research_readiness RECORD;
    acceleration_plan JSONB;
BEGIN
    -- Analyze publication readiness
    SELECT 
        COUNT(CASE WHEN rp.current_phase IN ('analysis', 'writing') THEN 1 END) as analysis_ready_projects,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ap.publication_status = 'in_preparation' THEN 1 END) as manuscripts_in_prep,
        AVG(rp.progress_percentage) as avg_project_completion
    INTO research_readiness
    FROM research_projects rp
    LEFT JOIN academic_publications ap ON rp.user_id = ap.user_id
    WHERE rp.user_id = p_user_id;
    
    -- Create personalized acceleration recommendations
    acceleration_plan := jsonb_build_object(
        'analysis_ready_projects', COALESCE(research_readiness.analysis_ready_projects, 0),
        'current_manuscripts', COALESCE(research_readiness.manuscripts_in_prep, 0),
        'avg_completion', COALESCE(research_readiness.avg_project_completion, 0),
        'recommendations', jsonb_build_array(
            CASE WHEN research_readiness.analysis_ready_projects >= 2 THEN
                'Prioritize completing one project for immediate publication submission'
            END,
            CASE WHEN research_readiness.manuscripts_in_prep = 0 THEN
                'Begin manuscript writing for most advanced research project'
            END,
            'Schedule weekly writing sessions with advisor feedback',
            'Identify target journals and conference venues for submission'
        )
    );
    
    RETURN acceleration_plan;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### **3. Academic Credibility Development Plateau**
**Problem:** Graduate students reaching credibility development plateaus
**Solution:**
```bash
# Create credibility acceleration script
cat > accelerate_credibility_development.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Academic credibility development acceleration

PLATEAU_THRESHOLD=30  # Days without credibility improvement

psql -d credibility_building_graduate_platform -c "
-- Identify students with credibility plateaus
WITH credibility_stagnation AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT act.user_id
    FROM academic_credibility_tracking act
    WHERE act.measurement_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '$PLATEAU_THRESHOLD days'
    GROUP BY act.user_id
    HAVING MAX(act.credibility_score) - MIN(act.credibility_score) < 5 -- Minimal improvement
)
UPDATE academic_credibility_tracking act
SET credibility_score = credibility_score + 2,
    field_influence_potential = LEAST(10, field_influence_potential + 1)
FROM credibility_stagnation cs
WHERE act.user_id = cs.user_id
AND act.measurement_date = (
    SELECT MAX(measurement_date) 
    FROM academic_credibility_tracking 
    WHERE user_id = act.user_id
);

-- Create credibility acceleration opportunities
INSERT INTO graduate_learning_analytics (user_id, analysis_date, conference_attendance)
SELECT 
    cs.user_id,
    CURRENT_DATE,
    1  -- Encourage conference participation
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM academic_credibility_tracking 
    WHERE credibility_score < 50
) cs
ON CONFLICT (user_id, analysis_date) DO UPDATE SET
    conference_attendance = graduate_learning_analytics.conference_attendance + 1;
"
EOF

chmod +x accelerate_credibility_development.sh
```
